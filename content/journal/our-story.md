Our story began when we fell in love with transforming vintage  furniture. The back porch became our workplace as we experimented with  different painting techniques. We sold our items in booths that we  rented in local antique malls.

The weather, along with strenuous trips to and from our little places  of business began to wear on us, and wet our appetites to open a store  of our own, so began our journey to find the perfect venue.

We chose the town of Eclectic because it was half way between our homes  in Wetumpka and Lake Martin. A former little post office building had  just become available to rent and after lots of prayer, we took the  plunge! We opened our doors during the annual Cotton Festival in October  of 2015, meeting the sweet people of Eclectic for the first time.   Loving all things southern- we decided to name our store a phrase heard  throughout the south, …Bless Your Heart.

Our furniture began to sell, but rather slowly and we saw a greater  interest in our Farmhouse and French country decor. We crafted and  repurposed most of our items, but quickly realized that we could no  longer keep up with the demand. We discovered the Atlanta market and  spent lots of time searching for unique items that couldn’t be found in  just any store.

We were amazed at how quickly our business grew, and within 2 years, we  needed more room. We asked the Lord for guidance, and a larger building  became available. We had been looking in the windows of an old former  hardware store just down the street, and had a vision of what could  become a quaint, beautiful home décor store. After many weeks of  cleaning, painting and refurbishing, Bless Your Heart reopened in  September of 2017.

Our Grand Opening was amazing, as many of our customers walked in our  doors in awe of how the old hardware store had been transformed! Amy’s  talent and experience in building homes and interior design compliments  Melanie’s background in floral design and makes for a wonderful  partnership. We added florals and our customers have loved it! Flowers  bring the outdoors inside and the vibrant colors bring life to Bless  Your Heart.

We continue to offer our customers decorating services… everything  from a mantle or a wall to an entire home. We love hearing our customers  say that the vision for their home has come true. Our home is our haven  and needs to be a place of serenity. It is our desire to provide this  for our customers.

We’re so blessed to be a mother/daughter team, fulfilling our passion and serving others. Our store is our happy place!

We look forward to meeting you and hope that Bless Your Heart becomes your happy place too!
