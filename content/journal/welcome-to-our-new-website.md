Our story began when we fell in love with transforming vintage furniture. The back porch became our workplace as we experimented with different painting techniques. We sold our items in booths that we rented in local antique malls.

The weather, along with strenuous trips to and from our little places of business began to wear on us, and wet our appetites to open a store of our own, so began our journey to find the perfect venue.
