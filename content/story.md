  heading: It All Began
  content: "Our story began when we fell in love with transforming vintage furniture.
    The back porch became our workplace as we experimented with different painting
    techniques. We sold our items in booths that we rented in local antique malls.
    \n\nThe weather, along with strenuous trips to and from our little places of business
    began to wear on us, and wet our appetites to open a store of our own, so began
    our journey to find the perfect venue."

  heading: A Place To Call Home
  content: We chose the town of Eclectic because it was half way between our homes
    in Wetumpka and Lake Martin. A former little post office building had just become
    available to rent and after lots of prayer, we took the plunge! We opened our
    doors during the annual Cotton Festival in October of 2015, meeting the sweet
    people of Eclectic for the first time.  Loving all things southern- we decided
    to name our store a phrase heard throughout the south, …Bless Your Heart.

  heading: Just The Begining
  content: Our furniture began to sell, but rather slowly and we saw a greater interest
    in our Farmhouse and French country decor. We crafted and repurposed most of our
    items, but quickly realized that we could no longer keep up with the demand. We
    discovered the Atlanta market and spent lots of time searching for unique items
    that couldn’t be found in just any store.

  content: We were amazed at how quickly our business grew, and within 2 years, we
    needed more room. We asked the Lord for guidance, and a larger building became
    available. We had been looking in the windows of an old former hardware store
    just down the street, and had a vision of what could become a quaint, beautiful
    home décor store. After many weeks of cleaning, painting and refurbishing, Bless
    Your Heart reopened in September of 2017.

  heading: Our Grand Opening
  content: Our Grand Opening was amazing, as many of our customers walked in our doors
    in awe of how the old hardware store had been transformed! Amy’s talent and experience
    in building homes and interior design compliments Melanie’s background in floral
    design and makes for a wonderful partnership. We added florals and our customers
    have loved it! Flowers bring the outdoors inside and the vibrant colors bring
    life to Bless Your Heart.
